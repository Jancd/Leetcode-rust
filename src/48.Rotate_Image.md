You are given an `n x n` 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by `90` degrees (clockwise).

Note:

You have to rotate the image [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

**Example 1:**

```
Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given input matrix =
[
  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15,14,12,16]
], 

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [15,13, 2, 5],
  [14, 3, 4, 1],
  [12, 6, 8, 9],
  [16, 7,10,11]
]
```

Solution:

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn rotate(matrix: &mut Vec<Vec<i32>>) {
        let (row, col) = (matrix.len(), matrix[0].len());
        for i in 0..row {
            for j in i..col {
                let tmp = matrix[i][j];
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i];
                matrix[j][i] = tmp;
            }
        }
        for i in 0..row {
            for j in 0..col/2 {
                matrix[i].swap(j, col-j-1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
