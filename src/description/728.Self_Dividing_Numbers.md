 A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because `128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0`, and `128 % 8 == 0`.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]
```

**Note:**
- The boundaries of each input argument are `1 <= left <= right <= 10000`.

Solution:

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn self_dividing_numbers(left: i32, right: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
        (left..=right).filter(|m| {
            let mut n = *m;
            while n != 0 {
                if n % 10 == 0 || m % (n % 10) != 0 {
                    return false
                }
                n /= 10;
            }
            true
        }).collect()
    }
}
```
